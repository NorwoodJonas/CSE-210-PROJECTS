Requirements:
    -Have a scripture and reference (e.g. John 2:4)
    -Allow for range of verses (e.g. Matthew 3:5-7)
    -Clear console and display scripture
    -Tell user to press enter or type quit
    -If user presses enter clear screen and redisplay scripture with some words hidden
    -Keep prompting until all words are hidden
    -If no words left, then exit program

    -Use encapsulation
    -At least 3 classes in addition to program (They want one for the scripture, one for the reference, and one for the word)
    -Provide multiple constructors (One for scriptures with one verse, others with 2)

Classes:
    Program
        -Main() //loops through displaying and removing words from scriptures
    
    Scripture
        -Private List<words> verse
        -Private Reference ref
        -
        -Scripture(Reference, list<string> Verse) //makes a scripture in the easiest way, ref = reference verse = Verse
        -Scripture(book, verse, string verse) //Makes a scripture with book, verse, and a string that is the verse
        -Scripture(book, verse) //this may not be done, it would get the data from the internet somewhere
        -
        -Display() //displays reference, then words by looping through each word with a space at the end.
        -RandomlyRemoveWord() //Goes through list of words and sets random ones that have a true visibility false
    
    Reference
        -Private string book
        -Private list<int> verses
        -
        -Reference(book, verse) //constructors pretty self explanatory
        -Reference(book, verse, verseEnd)
        -View() //returns as string

    Word
        -string word
        -bool visibility
        -
        -Word(string word) //basic constructor
        -
        -View() //returns the word if visibility is true, if it is false it returns "_" as long as the word
        -SetVisibility() //getters and setter, could do in a lot of ways
        -GetVisibility()

Interaction: //shows levels in which classes are being used in where
