Requirements:
    -Make a checklist kind of thing
    -Keep track of points
    -Pretty simple

Classes:
    -Program
    -FileSave
    -Goal
        -Eternal //indentation shows inheritance
        -checklist


Program:
    -Main(): Has a list of goals, also handles the menu

FileSave: //probably static
    -Save() //Uses delimeters to save each goal to a newline, may need something to specify what kind of goal is on each line
    -Load() //Loads

Goal: //assume all goal classes have constructors
    -int points
    -bool completed
    -string goal
    *
    -Goal(string goal, int points) //A constructor
    -DisplayGoal() //Returns a string
    -CompleteGoal() //Turns completed to true
    -GetPoints() //Gets how many points this goal has currently and returns them

EternalG:
    -int timesCompleted
    *
    -EternalG(string goal, int points)
    -override CompleteGoal() //Adds one to times completed
    -override DisplayGoal()
    -override GetPoints() //timesCompleted * points


ChecklistG:
    -int bonus
    -int timesCompleted
    -int timesWantToComplete
    *
    -ChecklistG(string goal, int points, int bonus points, int times) //Wow, a constructor
    -override CompleteGoal() //Adds another to times completed
    -override DisplayGoal()
