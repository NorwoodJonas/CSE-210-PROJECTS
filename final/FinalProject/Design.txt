SynthOrganThing:

Goal:
    -Be able to create audio
    -Select which sounds are being layered
    -needs 8 classes

    Classes:
        -pipe (general term for class that generates waveform, with functioncs such as return point in wave or whatever)
            -Additive Synth (Defines based on oscillators and selection) //define waveforms based on sines and cosines?
            -FM Synth (Defined based on oscilators oscillating oscillators)
            -Sample (Defined based on audio files)
            -Ambient Noise? (Outputs microphone input)
        -Console (manages what pipes are played with the keyboard)
        -Input(Gets input from user)
        -Program(Starts everything and manages what is happening)
        -sequencer (takes and input melody and loops it)
            -Arpeggiator


or

Try implementing NLP

    How?
        -Put input into array
        -Reference with dictionary
        -Look for similar words for those unknown
        -Make an array defining what words are what
        -Reference verb requested with closest command
        -Use command with most relevant rest of request
        -Return input

        Classes:
            -dictionary //reference for all words
            -Command //Various actions, probably static
            -UserInput //Find a better name, runs NLP when instantiated with a string[]
            -Program
            -World //Not enough classes, so maybe combine with a simple text adventure?
            -Area //Tells which areas are linked and gives description
            -Character
            -Item //use object on thing, passes reference to object
            -npc

or maybe just do a complex text adventure
